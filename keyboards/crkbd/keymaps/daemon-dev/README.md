Going for a Engram layout based on [Arno's Engram](https://engram.dev/) on the crkbd.

I'm currently hacving issues with RGB On my keyboard when enabled, so have disabled that for
now.

I build with ```qmk compile -kb crkbd/rev1 -km daemon-dev```

Currently on my keyboard I believe I have a faulty connection after the first underglow LED on the right half. Needs investigating as I have done all the firmware checks I can think of.
